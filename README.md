This is the development version of a new Airtraffic Data protocol. 


### Goals ###

As the UTM ecosystem evolves, capturing and recording real-time air traffic data becomes important. This protocol was developed after consultations with industry experts aims to standardize the way air traffic data is collected and transmitted in a way that suits the UTM ecosystem. The best way to engage with this is to review the protocol document, the goals and open issues in this repository. Eventually a version of this repository will be handed to the GUTMA board to be accepted as a "formal" GUTMA protocol and this repository will continue to function as a way to test and change it.
